## Python Implementation
 
This project is the python implementation of this matlab project: https://github.com/Philipp-MR/CoilGen.
At the moment it is NOT finished. Working was stopped in calcCountoursByTriangularPotentialCuts.py, until there in a testcase the results are similar to the ones in the matlab implementation.


## Testing with Pytest

There is a testcase implemented in testCase.py, on which it could be evaluated if the program still does what it should do. The results there are checked against the ones of the same case in the matlab project. For testing pytest is used. 

If not already installed run: pip install -U pytest
To run the tests: pytest
